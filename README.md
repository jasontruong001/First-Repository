# First-Repository
In this repository, I go through the Django tutorial.
# Tutorial 1
I follow the instructions to create my first project using command django-admin startproject mysite

I go into the mysite directory and create polls

I edit views.py in polls

Created urls.py and follow instructions to add code into urls.py with nano text editor

Finished up rest of tutorial 1 and everything ran correctly so far.
